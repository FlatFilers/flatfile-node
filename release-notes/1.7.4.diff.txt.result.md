#### General Changes

- Updated the package version from 1.7.3 to 1.7.4 in `package.json`.
- Removed `src/core/fetcher/Fetcher.ts` from the `.fernignore` file, allowing it to be included in the package.

#### Fetcher

- Added a `RUNTIME` import from `../runtime` in `src/core/fetcher/Fetcher.ts`.
- Modified the logic for determining the `fetch` function to use:
  - If running in a Node.js environment (`RUNTIME.type === "node"`), always use `node-fetch`.
  - Otherwise, use the global `fetch` function if available, and fall back to `node-fetch` if not.

No other changes to the external API surface were detected in this diff.
