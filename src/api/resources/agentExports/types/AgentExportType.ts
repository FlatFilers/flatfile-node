 * A source export will attempt to deobfuscate the minified agent code. An autobuild_inlined export will generate an agent as it is created during the autobuild process except stored constraints will be converted to external constraints and all blueprints, space configuration, documents, and constraint code will be exported directly into the agent instead of pulling dynamically from the Flatfile APIs.
 *
 * @example
 *     Flatfile.AgentExportType.AutobuildInlined
